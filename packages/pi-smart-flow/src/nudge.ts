const DELEGATION_GUIDANCE = `<delegation_guidance>
You have a subagent tool. Delegate aggressively to keep this main context clean.

Delegate when:
- Exploration or search spans multiple files/modules, or you need to read bulk output (logs, large files, test runs) whose raw content would flood this context.
- A workstream is independent: research, code review, debugging a self-contained failure, or implementing an approved, well-scoped change.
- You would otherwise read more than ~2 files just to answer "where/what" before acting.

Work inline when:
- Reading a known file, looking up a single symbol, or making a bounded one-to-two-file edit.

How to delegate well:
- Prefer async: true. Launch the subagent, continue your own local work, and collect results when they are needed instead of blocking.
- Pick the role that fits: scout for codebase recon, researcher for web evidence, reviewer for adversarial review, worker for implementation, planner for plans, oracle for direction checks.
- Write the task as a compact contract: GOAL, CONTEXT (files/decisions/constraints), EXPECTED OUTPUT (shape and where), STOP RULES (when to report back or ask).
- Use outputMode: "file-only" for large reports; read the saved file selectively instead of absorbing the whole output.
- Keep one writer: never edit files an async worker is changing; run parallel writers only in isolated worktrees.
- After three failed attempts at the same problem, stop — delegate a fresh investigation or ask the user for direction.
